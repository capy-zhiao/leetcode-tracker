"""Pluggable LLM layer: interview follow-ups, answer grading and complexity checks.

Two providers are supported and selected with LLM_PROVIDER:

  anthropic — Claude. Uses native structured outputs (`messages.parse`), so the response
              is already a validated Pydantic object. Best quality follow-ups.
  deepseek  — DeepSeek via its OpenAI-compatible API. Roughly 30x cheaper; JSON mode plus
              manual Pydantic validation, since it has no strict-schema equivalent.

Design principle: **graceful degradation**. With LLM_PROVIDER=none (or a missing key) these
functions return empty results and the rest of the app keeps working — no hard dependency.

They stated: time {stated_time or "(blank)"}, space {stated_space or "(blank)"}.
{ref}
Rules:
- Analyse the code AS WRITTEN, including any inefficiency it has.
- Space means auxiliary space (recursion stack, hash maps, queues), excluding the returned
  output — but if the candidate's answer is only right when the output is counted, and
  that is a reasonable reading, accept it.
- Accept equivalent notation: O(n) for O(V) when n is the node count, O(m*n) for O(n*m),
  a stated bound that differs only by a constant.
- Do not accept a looser or tighter bound: O(n) is wrong for O(n log n), and O(n^2) is
  wrong for O(n) unless the code really is quadratic.
- Use the bounds interviewers use; do not re-derive amortised analyses. Union-Find with
  path compression counts as near-constant per operation, O(α(n)) ≈ O(1), whether or not
  it also unions by rank — do not dwell on the O(log n) path-compression-only bound. Hash
  map operations are O(1) average; comparison sorting is O(n log n).
- Keep your reasoning short: this is a quick judgement, not a proof.
- Big-O fields hold notation only, such as O(n log n) — never words or alternatives.
- why_wrong: only when an answer is wrong. Say what they missed, naming the variables
  (n = ..., V = ..., E = ...). Leave it empty when both answers are right.
- time_optimal / space_optimal: judge each separately; equivalent notation is equal.
- optimal_how and optimized_code: only when time OR space is not optimal.
- optimized_code: rewrite THEIR code minimally to reach the optimum, so a diff against
  their code shows only the optimisation. Copy every line that does not need to change
  exactly as written — same formatting, one-line ifs, blank lines, comments, spacing. Do
  not add imports (the judge provides them), type hints, docstrings or comments.
- Never use placeholders such as "..." — write the actual content or leave it empty."""

Ask the {n} follow-up questions you would ask about THIS code in a real interview. Rules:
- Ground each question in the code on screen — refer to its actual choices (the recursion,
  the extra array, the data structure picked, how it handles a particular input).
- If the stated complexity is wrong, or the code is not optimal, one question should
  probe that without giving the answer away.
- Mix angles: optimisation or trade-offs, an edge case or failure mode this code might
  hit, and a requirement change (scale, streaming, concurrency, a variant of the problem).
- Order from easier to harder. One sentence per question, no hints inside the question.
- If a question uses an input the problem's constraints rule out, say so in the question,
  and write key points that accept any well-reasoned behaviour rather than one answer.
- For each, give the key points a strong answer covers (two or three sentences). These
  are hidden from the candidate until they answer."""

Your question: {question}

Their answer (verbatim, between the tags):

Grading:
- 4 strong: correct and complete, would move the interview forward with confidence
- 3 good: correct with a minor gap
- 2 partial: right direction but a significant gap or imprecision
- 1 weak: incorrect, or does not address the question
Judge the substance, not the wording or language — a terse correct answer is still
correct. Credit valid points that are not in your key points. Be specific about what is
missing; do not invent gaps to fill the list.

Your key points were written in advance and may be incomplete or wrong. If the answer
contradicts them with a sound argument, re-check the problem statement and constraints
yourself instead of deducting for the disagreement. Where the question is genuinely
ambiguous (for example an input the problem's constraints rule out), accept any
well-reasoned position and say that it is ambiguous."""
