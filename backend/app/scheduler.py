"""Builds the daily queue.

Every day you get three things:
  1. Due reviews  — what SRS says is due, ranked by priority(), capped at N
  2. New problems — the rest of the NeetCode 150 in roadmap order, then the 250
                    additions shuffled (Bit & Math with them), Hards last
  3. A template   — one of the 15 algorithm templates, also on an SRS schedule

Key design decision: **overflow defers**. Twenty problems may be due on a day you can only
finish four. Rather than dumping all twenty, the queue hands you the N that matter most and
rolls the rest forward.

Second decision: **the day is interleaved**. Ranking alone clusters: failures concentrate
in whichever chapter was hardest, so the top four can all be graph problems. Four of the
same kind in a row means you know the technique before reading the problem, which skips
the step an interview actually tests — recognising it. pick_diverse() caps each chapter
and each primary pattern per day, then backfills so no slot goes unused.
