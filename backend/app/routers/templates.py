"""Template blind-write drills.

The markdown notes had a practice ground where you wrote a template from memory, then
scrolled to the bottom and compared by eye. This automates the comparison half: the
reference stays hidden until you submit, and the grading is done by checkpoints rather
than by eye, so "I basically had it" stops being a judgement call.

Grading itself lives in blindwrite.py as pure functions; this module only wires it to HTTP.
