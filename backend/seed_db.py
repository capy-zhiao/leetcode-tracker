"""Build the problem set (NeetCode 150 + LeetCode's Top Interview 150 and LeetCode 75)
and the 15 templates.

Problems come from data/seed.json (extracted from the NeetCode markdown notes, with notes
and solutions) and the study plans in data/ (see app/study_plans.py). Problems in none of
the lists are removed — but only if they have no practice history.

Usage:  python seed_db.py           incremental: add new problems, keep attempt history
        python seed_db.py --reset   wipe and start over

Problems already solved in the markdown notes start out "due today", so the very first
daily queue picks up where the manual study plan left off.
